# SMS ALERT FROM PIPEDRIVE INCOMING LEADS

## NODE.JS

### Pipedrive API integration
### Google Spreadsheet integration

This project was developed to send text messages when a new deal in a Pipedrive filter doesn't have any action after 15 and 30 minutes. Data are stored in a Google spreadsheet. ZAPIER reads the spreadsheet to send the messages. 

The text messages are sending by ZAPIER integration as client specification.
